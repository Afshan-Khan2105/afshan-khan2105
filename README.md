👋 Hey, I’m Afshan! 💻 | Web Dev Enthusiast & Aspiring AI Explorer
Here’s a bit about me:

Frontend: I love building responsive, dynamic, and visually delightful web experiences using React, JavaScript, and good ol’ HTML & CSS.

Backend: Slowly but surely mastering Node.js, Express, and the art of APIs.

AI: Currently exploring ways to make websites smarter with AI—because why not add a brain to the beauty?

🎨 I have a thing for designing in Figma and making cool visuals in Canva.

🤓 I learn best by doing (and failing, because mistakes are part of the journey).

🎮 When I’m not coding, you’ll find me playing badminton, doodling, hitting the gym, or bingeing something tech-y.

📈 Here’s a peek at what I’m working on and learning:

✨ AI + Web Dev Projects: Experimenting with OpenAI APIs and TensorFlow.js for fun, intelligent features.

🌐 Portfolio: Building a portfolio that screams "creative, fun, and techy" (because first impressions matter, right?).
